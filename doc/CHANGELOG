- Version 3.2:
  - Fixes to the transformation model -- previously, there were cases where
    transformations didn't apply correctly to a tree of turtle commands.

  - Ported the code to a literate documentation system.

- Version 3.1:
  - Added support for rendering faces via the CartesianTriangle object.
  - Added incidence angle computation for shading.

- Version 3.0:
  - Improved responsiveness during a line-retrieval operation by making that step
    interruptible.

  - Added text rendering via the cheloniidae.resources.BasicTextRenderer class.
  - Added line-counting to the TurtleWindow class.
  - Added a dark single-turtle scene.
  - Added inductive replication and recursion to the turtle command framework.
  - Added several new example files.

- Version 3.0-pre2:
  - Cleaned up the API for turtle commands (another large reorganization) and wrote
    a single-turtle frame.

  - Converted some example files to the new setup.

- Version 3.0-pre1:
  - Reorganized structure to allow for turtle commands.
  - Deleted several old example files.

- Version 2.1:
  - Reimplemented depth sorting with cached line distances and less memory
    allocation. The user interface is correspondingly more responsive.
  - Added several new example files.

- Version 2.0:
  - Changed the invocation of Java's built-in mergesort to a quicksort that
    allows interruption during a depth-sort operation. This increased responsiveness
    of the user-interface during multiple drags.

  - Fixed perspective transformation for lines that extended into negative-Z
    space. Now the renderer correctly solves for the intersection with the viewplane.

  - Added the ORTHOGONAL_PLANAR coordinate model.
  - Moved the depth-sorting out of the event thread. This also increased responsiveness
    while dragging.

  - Converted several magic numbers in the source code to constants.
