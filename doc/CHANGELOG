Version 2.1:

	* Reimplemented depth sorting with cached line distances and less memory
	  allocation. The user interface is correspondingly more responsive.

	* Added several new example files.

Version 2.0:

	* Changed the invocation of Java's built-in mergesort to a quicksort that
	  allows interruption during a depth-sort operation. This increased responsiveness
	  of the user-interface during multiple drags.
	
	* Fixed perspective transformation for lines that extended into negative-Z
	  space. Now the renderer correctly solves for the intersection with the viewplane.
	
	* Added the ORTHOGONAL_PLANAR coordinate model.

	* Moved the depth-sorting out of the event thread. This also increased responsiveness
	  while dragging.
	
	* Converted several magic numbers in the source code to constants.
