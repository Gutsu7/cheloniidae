All of the class files in this directory are examples and tests. You should be
able to type

  java spheres

for example, and Cheloniidae should draw a bunch of nested spheres. The view
angle can be changed by dragging the mouse (use shift for rotation and control
to slow down movement), and you can zoom by using the mouse wheel.

To recompile the Cheloniidae core classes, just run:

  javac cheloniidae/*.java cheloniidae/*/*.java

This may be necessary depending on your Java environment.

See the PDF files included with Cheloniidae:

  cheloniidae.pdf           (a short introduction)
  cheloniidae-literate.pdf  (a tour of the source code)

for a more complete guide to getting started.
