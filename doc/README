All of the class files in this directory are examples and tests. You should be
able to type

	java spheres

for example, and Terrapin should draw two spheres. The view angle can be
changed by dragging the mouse with various combinations of control and shift
pressed (see the "Mouse Operations" section of the API docs in terrapin.pdf).

To recompile the Terrapin core classes, just run:

	javac terrapin/*.java

This may be necessary depending on your Java environment.
