All of the class files in this directory are examples and tests. You should be
able to type

  java spheres

for example, and Cheloniidae should draw two spheres. The view angle can be
changed by dragging the mouse with various combinations of control and shift
pressed (see the "Mouse Operations" section of the API docs in cheloniidae.pdf).

To recompile the Cheloniidae core classes, just run:

  javac cheloniidae/*.java cheloniidae/*/*.java

This may be necessary depending on your Java environment.
