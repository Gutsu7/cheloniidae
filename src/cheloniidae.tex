  \section{Introduction}
    \label{sec:introduction}

    Cheloniidae is a high-performance turtle graphics platform that is focused on generating antialiased, complex images. To this end, it has support for
    multiple turtles, turtle networks, 3D coordinate spaces, translucent lines, and optically-accurate projective rendering.

    A Cheloniidae scene is built by creating a drawing window and then adding turtles and other drawing objects to the window.
