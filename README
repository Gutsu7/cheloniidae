Cheloniidae: 3D turtle graphics for Java

When I wrote this I didn't really know how Java builds worked, so the layout
is a bit unusual. Source is in src/, example source is in examples/, and all
of the class files are in build/. I think I'm also copying src/ into build/ so
that any JARs that get built contain the source as well as the class files.

To run examples:

$ cd build/
$ java spheres          # should work
