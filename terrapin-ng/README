Terrapin is written using literate Java, so the actual .java files are not very
readable. To read the source code, open the PDF files, which not only contain
the code itself but also nicely-formatted documentation.

WARNING: When editing the source, be sure to make all changes to the TeX files,
not the Java files! The Java files are regenerated from the TeX files, so any
changes made to them directly will be lost.

To regenerate the source code after a modification, run make. If you just want
to regenerate the Java files, then you can run make src. Likewise, if you just
want to regenerate the PDFs, you can run make doc.
