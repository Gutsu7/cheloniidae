    This interface defines the basic elements of a turtle based on the principle that a turtle interacts with a canvas and can draw lines on the canvas. The
    idea behind interaction is that the canvas, upon finding out that it owns a turtle, will invoke the turtle's {\tt setCanvas} method. When the operational
    subclass of the turtle wants to draw a line, it will invoke the {\tt drawLine} method, which will interface with the canvas appropriately to make that
    happen.

    \begin{javacode}
package terrapin;

import java.io.Serializable;

public interface ITurtle extends Serializable {
  void           setCanvas (ITurtleCanvas canvas);
  protected void drawLine  (Line line);
}
    \end{javacode}
